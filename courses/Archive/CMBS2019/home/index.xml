      <description>A unique introduction to research methods developed to study complex adaptive dynamical systems and networks. Get hands-on experience applying a new, powerful analytic toolbox to time and trial series of human behaviour and physiology.
Complexity research transcends the boundaries between the classical scientific disciplines and is a hot topic in physics, mathematics, biology, economy as well as psychology and the life sciences. This course will discuss techniques that allow for the study of human behaviour from the perspective of the Complexity Sciences, specifically, the study of complex physical systems that are alive and display complex adaptive behaviour such as learning, development and creativity.</description>
