This workshop will provide an introduction to some of the formal models, research methods, and analytical techniques that allow for the study of human behaviour from a complex systems perspective. No special background knowledge is required to participate.\nLearning outcomes At the end of this course, students have reached a level of understanding that will allow them to:\n Study relevant scientific literature using a complex systems approach to behavioural science. Getting help with using a complex systems approach in their own scientific inquiries, e.g. by being able to ask relevant questions to experts on a specific topic discussed during the course. Work through tutorials on more advanced topics that were not discussed during the course. Keep up with the continuous influx of new theoretical, methodological and empirical studies on applying the complex systems approach in the social and behavioural sciences.  Content Complexity research transcends the boundaries between the classical scientific disciplines and—having been a hot topic in physics, mathematics and biology—has recently gained much traction in the social sciences. It provides a rigorous, non-reductionist way to approach the context-dependence of social phenomena, as well as individual agentic human behaviour.\nThe focus is a description and explanation of behaviour based on interaction dominant dynamics: Many processes interact on different temporal and spatial scales (including across the micro-, meso and macro-levels), and behaviour emerges out of those interactions through physical processes such as self-organization or soft-assembly.\nContrary to what the name might suggest, complexity research is often about finding simple models or collective variables with which a wide range of different behavioural modes can be described. This approach differs fundamentally from the more classical approaches in which behaviour is considered the additive result of many independent, component processes (component dominant dynamics) and the goal of research is to identify efficient causes of behaviour.\nTentative program: I. Introduction to the mathematics of change\n Modelling (nonlinear) growth Predator-Prey dynamics and Deterministic Chaos Basic timeseries analysis Scaling phenomena in time and trial series of human behaviour and physiology  II. Quantifying Recurrences in State Space\n Takens' Theorem and State-Space reconstruction Recurrence Quantification Analysis of continuous and categorical data Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis of dyadic interaction  III. Network Topology and Early Warning Signals\n Early Warning Signals in clinical interventions Representing time series as complex networks  Teaching and learning methods Each meeting starts with a lecture addressing the theoretical and methodological backgrounds of the practical applications that will be used in hands-on assignments during the practical sessions.\n  Course site: https://complexity-methods.github.io\n  Sometimes there are links to websites that have additional literature, one such source we call “the course book”: https://complexity-methods.github.io/book/\n  Additional literature will be made available during the course)\n  Most assignments about analyses were designed for R. You do not need to learn to script/code, you mainly need to be able to load data and run scripts. There will be instructions in lecture notes and assignment solutions that should give you enough information to work out what to do.\n  Modules have been developed for JAMOVI, download the modules here: https://complexity-methods.github.io/jamovi/\n  In order to get the 3 study credits, students reflect what they have learned by writing a learning diary (max. 3 pages), making use of the reading list (min. 10 articles) and referencing appropriately, and return the diary within 2 weeks from the end of the course to Nelli Hankonen, nelli.hankonen@helsinki.fi.\n Preliminary reading list Choose 10 from the list below:\n  Mathews, K.

This page is a brief introduction to the mathematics of change, most of the text and examples are copied from courses I teach on dynamics of complex systems Research Master Behavioural Science and the Radboud Summerschool: Complexity Methods for Behavioural Science. The summerschool been cancelled this year. So, I thought I might as well take some time to discuss some of the course topics that are relevant for understanding some of the (interpretations of the) data on the consequences of the current pandemic of the disease COVID-19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2.\nDespite the claims made by some behavioural scientists….\nHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah… “I have a PhD in social science”… hahahahahahttps://t.co/yWQrz8qnpY https://t.co/RttCXiR3DL — Fred Hasselman (@FredHasselman) April 6, 2020   …studying formal models of change processes and spreading of disease in social networks is not part of the standard analytical toolbox of the behavioural sciences including psychological science.\n  DISCLAIMER: I am not a medical doctor, epidemiologist or statistician. Yes, I do have a PhD in social science. The examples on this page are demonstrations of working with analytical solutions of differential equations and fitting them to data, they are not recommendations or claims about what will happen in the coming months. The data, however, are real. They represent people who are currently very ill, or who have sadly succumbed to the disease.   Mathematics of Change Change processes describe how a variable changes as a function of time. There are two ‘flavours’ of time: Discrete time (or metronome time) and continuous time. The associated formal description takes the form of difference equations (or maps) for discrete time and differential equations (of flows) for continuous time.\nThe notation of how a variable \\(Y\\) changes over time is different for each flavour of time. We’ll start with one of the simplest growth processes, linear growth in discrete time, for example, the interest you get when you put money in a savings account. The money you get after some period of time is proportional to what you started out with (the initial condition, \\(Y_{i=0}\\)), and the interest rate \\(r\\). Putting those components together produces the difference equation known as the linear map:\n\\[ Y_{i+1} = r*Y_i \\] The index \\(i\\) is often used (instead of \\(t\\)) to indicate we are using discrete steps of time 1. The equation translates to: “The value of \\(Y\\), one step of time into the future, is equal to the value of \\(Y\\) right now (\\(i\\)), times the value of \\(r\\)”. So, if I start out with \\(Y_{i=0} = 10\\) Euros at an interest rate of \\(r = 1.1\\) and wait \\(6\\) months, we can iterate the function to see how much money I end up with:\n\\[ \\begin{align} Y_{0} \u0026amp;= 10 \\\\ Y_{1} \u0026amp;= 1.1 * 10\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ = 11 \\\\ Y_{2} \u0026amp;= 1.1 * 11\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ = 12.1 \\\\ Y_{3} \u0026amp;= 1.1 * 12.1\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ = 13.31 \\\\ Y_{4} \u0026amp;= 1.1 * 13.31\\ \\ \\ \\ = 14.641 \\\\ Y_{5} \u0026amp;= 1.1 * 14.641\\ \\ = 16.1051 \\\\ Y_{6} \u0026amp;= 1.1 * 16.1051 = 17.71561 \\\\ \\end{align} \\]\nNumerical Solutions Let’s make a plot of this process in R and increase the number of iterations to 12 months:\nY0 \u0026lt;- 10 r \u0026lt;- 1.1 Niter \u0026lt;- 12 Y \u0026lt;- c(Y0, rep(NA,Niter-1)) # Iteration for(i in 1:(Niter-1)){ Y[i+1] \u0026lt;- r*Y[i] } plot(x = 1:Niter, y = Y, type = \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, ylim = c(0,40)) This iteration is called a numerical solution, because we have to actually calulate the value of \\(Y\\) at each step of the iteration. For a very limited number of difference and differential equations, there is an analytical solution of the process, which allows you to get to the value of Y at any given point in time, for any given value of parameters and initial conditions.\n Analytical solutions Remember that the analytical solution for the logistic equation is:\n\\[ Y(t) = \\frac{K * Y_0}{Y_0 + \\left(K - Y_0 \\right) * e^{-r*t} } \\] This can be ‘simplified’ to\n\\[ Y(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K}{Y_0-1} \\right) * e^{-r*t} } \\]\nIf we want to know the growth level \\(Y_t\\) at \\(t=10\\), with \\(Y_0=.0001\\), \\(r=1.1\\) and \\(K=4\\), we can just fill it in:\n# Define a function for the solution logSol \u0026lt;- function(Y0, r, K, t){K/(1+(K/Y0-1)*exp(-r*t))} # Call the function logSol(Y0=.0001, r=1.1, K=4, t=10) ## [1] 2.398008 We can pass a vector of time points to create the exact solution, the same we would get if we were to iterate the differential/difference equation.\n# Plot from t=1 to t=100 plot(logSol(Y0=.0001, r=1.1, K=4, t=seq(1,20)), type = \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, ylab = expression(Y[t]), xlab = \u0026quot;t\u0026quot;) # Plot t=10 in red points(10,logSol(Y0=.0001, r=1.1, K=4, t=10), col=\u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, pch=16)  Numerical solution (discrete) If we would iterate the differential equation …\n\\[ \\frac{dY}{dt} = Y_t * (1 + r - r * \\frac{Y_t}{K}) \\]\n… as if it were a difference equation, we are not simulating continuous time, but a discrete time version of the model:\n\\[ Y_{i+1} = Y_i * (1 + r - r * \\frac{Y_i}{K}) \\]\nlogIter \u0026lt;- function(Y0,r,K,t){ N \u0026lt;- length(t) Y \u0026lt;- as.numeric(c(Y0, rep(NA,N-2))) sapply(seq_along(Y), function(t){ Y[[t+1]] \u0026lt;\u0026lt;- Y[t] * (1 + r - r * Y[t] / K)}) } # Plot from t=1 to t=100 plot(logIter(Y0=.0001, r=1.1, K=4, t=seq(1,20)), type = \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;, ylab = expression(Y[t]), xlab = \u0026quot;t\u0026quot;) # Plot t=10 in red points(10,logSol(Y0=.0001, r=1.1, K=4, t=10), col=\u0026quot;red\u0026quot;, pch=16)    Fitting Parameters of Analytic Solutions to differential Equations Fitting the Logistic Growth model in SPSS Open the file Growthregression.sav, it contains two variables: Time and Y(t).\nThis is data from an iteration of the logistic growth differential equation you are familiar with by now, but let’s pretend it’s data from one subject measured on 100 occasions.\n Plot Y(t) against Time Recognize the shape? To get the growth parameter we’ll try to fit the solution of the logistic flow with SPSS non-linear regression  Select non-linear… from the Analysis \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Regression menu. Here we can build the solution equation. We need three parameters: a. Yzero, the initial condition. b. K, the carrying capacity. c. r, the growth rate. Fill these in where it says parameters give all parameters a starting value of \\(0.01\\)   Take a good look at the analytic solution of the (stylized) logistic flow:\n\\[ Y(t) = \\frac{K * Y_0}{Y_0 + \\left(K-Y_{0}\\right) * e^{-r*t} } \\]\nTry to build this equation, the function for \\(e\\) is called EXP in SPSS (Function Group \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Arithmetic) Group terms by using parentheses as shown in the equation.\n If you think you have built the model correctly, click on Save choose predicted values. Then paste your syntax and run it!  Check the estimated parameter values. Check \\(R^2\\)!!!  Plot a line graph of both the original data and the predicted values. (Smile)  You can try do the same using a polynomial approach.\n A polynomial fishing expedition:  Create time-varying ‘covariates’ of \\(Y(t)\\):  COMPUTE T1=Yt * Time. COMPUTE T2=Yt * (Time ** 2). COMPUTE T3=Yt * (Time ** 3). COMPUTE T4=Yt * (Time ** 4). EXECUTE.  Use these variables as predictors of \\(Y(t)\\) in a regular linear regression analysis. This is called a polynomial regression: Fitting combinations of curves of different shapes on the data. Before you run the analysis: Click Save Choose Predicted Values: Unstandardized   Look at \\(R^2\\). This is also almost 1!\nWhich model is better?\nThink about this: Based on the results of the linear regression what can you tell about the growth rate, the carrying capacity or the initial condition?   Create a line graph of \\(Y(t)\\), plot the predicted values of the non-linear regression and the unstandardised predicted values of the linear polynomial regression against time in one figure.  Now you can see that the shape is approximated by the polynomials, but it is not quite the same. Is this really a model of a growth process as we could encounter it in nature?    Fitting the Logistic Growth model in R There are several packages that can perform non-linear regression analysis, the function most resembling the approach used by SPSS is nls in the default stats package.\nThe easiest way to do this is to first define your function (i.e., the solution) and then fit it using starting values for the parameters.\nlibrary(rio) df \u0026lt;- rio::import(\u0026quot;https://github.com/FredHasselman/The-Complex-Systems-Approach-Book/raw/master/assignments/assignment_data/BasicTSA_nonlinreg/GrowthRegression.sav\u0026quot;, setclass = \u0026quot;tbl_df\u0026quot;) # Create the function for the analytic solution # Same as SPSS syntax: PRED_=K*Yzero/(Yzero + (K-Yzero) * EXP(-1*(r * Time))). log.eq \u0026lt;- function(Yzero, r, K, Time) { K*Yzero/(Yzero + (K-Yzero) * exp(-1*(r * Time))) } There is one drawback and you can read about in the help pages:\n Warning.
