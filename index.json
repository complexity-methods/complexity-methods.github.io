This workshop will provide an introduction to some of the formal models, research methods, and analytical techniques that allow for the study of human behaviour from a complex systems perspective. No special background knowledge is required to participate.\nLearning outcomes At the end of this course, students have reached a level of understanding that will allow them to:\n Study relevant scientific literature using a complex systems approach to behavioural science. Getting help with using a complex systems approach in their own scientific inquiries, e.g. by being able to ask relevant questions to experts on a specific topic discussed during the course. Work through tutorials on more advanced topics that were not discussed during the course. Keep up with the continuous influx of new theoretical, methodological and empirical studies on applying the complex systems approach in the social and behavioural sciences.  Content Complexity research transcends the boundaries between the classical scientific disciplines and—having been a hot topic in physics, mathematics and biology—has recently gained much traction in the social sciences. It provides a rigorous, non-reductionist way to approach the context-dependence of social phenomena, as well as individual agentic human behaviour.\nThe focus is a description and explanation of behaviour based on interaction dominant dynamics: Many processes interact on different temporal and spatial scales (including across the micro-, meso and macro-levels), and behaviour emerges out of those interactions through physical processes such as self-organization or soft-assembly.\nContrary to what the name might suggest, complexity research is often about finding simple models or collective variables with which a wide range of different behavioural modes can be described. This approach differs fundamentally from the more classical approaches in which behaviour is considered the additive result of many independent, component processes (component dominant dynamics) and the goal of research is to identify efficient causes of behaviour.\nTentative program: I. Introduction to the mathematics of change\n Modelling (nonlinear) growth Predator-Prey dynamics and Deterministic Chaos Basic timeseries analysis Scaling phenomena in time and trial series of human behaviour and physiology  II. Quantifying Recurrences in State Space\n Takens\u0026rsquo; Theorem and State-Space reconstruction Recurrence Quantification Analysis of continuous and categorical data Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis of dyadic interaction  III. Network Topology and Early Warning Signals\n Early Warning Signals in clinical interventions Representing time series as complex networks  Teaching and learning methods Each meeting starts with a lecture addressing the theoretical and methodological backgrounds of the practical applications that will be used in hands-on assignments during the practical sessions.\n  Course site: https://complexity-methods.github.io\n  Sometimes there are links to websites that have additional literature, one such source we call “the course book”: https://complexity-methods.github.io/book/\n  Additional literature will be made available during the course)\n  Most assignments about analyses were designed for R. You do not need to learn to script/code, you mainly need to be able to load data and run scripts. There will be instructions in lecture notes and assignment solutions that should give you enough information to work out what to do.\n  Modules have been developed for JAMOVI, download the modules here: https://complexity-methods.github.io/jamovi/\n  In order to get the 3 study credits, students reflect what they have learned by writing a learning diary (max. 3 pages), making use of the reading list (min. 10 articles) and referencing appropriately, and return the diary within 2 weeks from the end of the course to Nelli Hankonen, nelli.hankonen@helsinki.fi.\n Preliminary reading list Choose 10 from the list below:\n  Mathews, K.
